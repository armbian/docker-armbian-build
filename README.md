### What does docker-armbian-build do?

Build and publish Docker images for the [Armbian Build Framework](https://github.com/armbian/build) to support isolated, reproducible, and architecture-independent builds. Images are tagged and pushed to the [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/armbian/packages) for use in CI pipelines, local development, and automation environments.
